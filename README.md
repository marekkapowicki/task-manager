# task-manager
I decided to use pure java (without lombok or any external library except guava for hashcodes/to_string etc)
For the tests the junit5 + assertj is used.

## Building 
There is a simple java (15) application shipped together with maven wrapper


Building command is 
```./mvnw clean install```

## Content
The application contains domain of the task-manager, together with the unit tests presenting how to use the domain (how to add/kill/list task)
There is no api (rest or something) and no application layer, but only a domain 

##Comments 
I decided to spend maximum one day on this task, and I did not want to exceed this slot. I am presenting the 
what I have done
